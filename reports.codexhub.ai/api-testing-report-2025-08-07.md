# API Testing Report for cf-viz

**Test Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Version**: Current Repository  
**Repository**: cf-viz

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive API testing report evaluates the cf-viz application, which is a frontend visualization tool for Codeforces user statistics. Our testing reveals that the application is a pure frontend implementation that directly interfaces with the Codeforces API without any intermediary backend. The repository also contains unrelated files for a Movie Booking App API which appear to be disconnected from the main application functionality.

Testing focused on the Codeforces API integration points, contract validation against the Codeforces API documentation, performance testing of the frontend application's data processing capabilities, and load testing to simulate multiple concurrent requests to the Codeforces API. Key findings include slow response times for users with large submission histories, potential rate limiting issues with the Codeforces API, and inefficient data processing patterns in the frontend code.

## 1. Repository Analysis

### 1.1 Application Overview

The cf-viz application is a frontend-only tool that provides visualizations for Codeforces user statistics, including:
- Problem solving patterns and statistics
- Submission verdicts distribution
- Programming languages used
- Problem tags and difficulty levels
- Submission heatmap over time
- User rating changes

### 1.2 API Integration Points

The application directly interfaces with the official Codeforces API through two key endpoints:
1. `user.status`: Retrieves all submissions made by a user
2. `user.rating`: Retrieves a user's rating change history

These API calls are implemented as direct AJAX requests using jQuery's `$.get()` method in the `single.js` file.

### 1.3 Application Architecture

```
[User Browser] --> [cf-viz Frontend (HTML/JS)] --> [Codeforces API]
```

- No backend or proxy API exists for this application
- All data processing occurs client-side in JavaScript
- Visualizations are rendered using Google Charts library

## 2. Contract Validation Results

### 2.1 Codeforces API Contract Compliance

| API Endpoint | Request Format | Response Processing | Compliance Status |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| `user.status` | ✅ Correct parameters | ✅ Handles all response fields | Compliant |
| `user.rating` | ✅ Correct parameters | ✅ Handles all response fields | Compliant |

### 2.2 Error Handling Assessment

| Error Scenario | Handling Implementation | Status |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------|
| User not found | Basic error message displayed | Adequate |
| API timeout | No explicit timeout handling | Deficient |
| Rate limiting | No handling for 429 responses | Deficient |
| Network failures | Generic error handling only | Deficient |

### 2.3 Contract Violations

No technical contract violations were found, but the error handling for API limits and failures could be improved.

   - Provide clear user feedback and recovery options
   - Expected Impact: Improved user experience during API failures

## 9. Conclusion

The cf-viz application is a lightweight frontend tool that provides valuable visualizations of Codeforces user statistics. The direct integration with the Codeforces API is functionally correct but lacks resilience features like proper error handling, rate limiting protection, and caching.

Performance testing reveals that the application works well for users with small to medium submission histories but struggles with larger profiles due to inefficient client-side data processing. The most critical improvements needed are implementing rate limit protection and optimizing data processing for large datasets.

By implementing the recommended optimizations, particularly client-side caching and progressive rendering, the application could maintain good performance even with large profiles while reducing the load on the Codeforces API.
